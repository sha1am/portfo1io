My portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and achievements. This repository now contains:

* **Frontend** – a React application inspired by [takeuforward profile](https://takeuforward.org/profile/sha1am).
* **Backend** – a simple Django REST Framework (DRF) API.
* **CI/CD** – example Jenkins pipeline for building and deploying both parts.

The frontend can be hosted on **Netlify** while the DRF backend can run on **Render**.
