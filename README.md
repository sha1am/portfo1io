# Portfolio

This repository contains:

- **frontend/** – a React application inspired by [takeuforward profile](https://takeuforward.org/profile/sha1am).
- **backend/** – a simple Django REST Framework (DRF) API.
- **Jenkinsfile** – example pipeline for building and deploying both parts.

Legacy code for a Flask dashboard and a small Node backend is kept in the `dashboard/` and `node_backend/` folders.

The frontend can be hosted on **Netlify** while the DRF backend can run on **Render**.
