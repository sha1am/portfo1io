This repo contains a simple portfolio dashboard powered by Flask and Plotly.
It displays links to my coding profiles, an interactive graph of solved
questions, and a list of recently solved problems.

Run the app locally with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Then visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser.
